3. Past Usage:

  The full dataset was described and analyzed in:

  S. Moro, R. Laureano and P. Cortez. Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology. 
  In P. Novais et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of the European Simulation and Modelling Conference - ESM'2011, pp. 117-121, Guimarães, 
  Portugal, October, 2011. EUROSIS.

4. Relevant Information:

   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 

   There are two datasets: 
      1) bank-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
      2) bank.csv with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from bank-full.csv.
   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).

   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

5. Number of Instances: 45211 for bank-full.csv (4521 for bank.csv)

6. Number of Attributes: 16 + output attribute.

7. Attribute information:

   3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
   4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")
   5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")
   6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric) 
   7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")
   8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")
   # related with the last contact of the current campaign:
   9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular") 
  10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
  11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
  12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
   # other attributes:
  13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
  14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
  15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
  16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")

  Output variable (desired target):#对应网络输出
  17 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")#客户是否办理了定期存款？

补充：
1.共16个特性，网络输入为16维。二分类网络，和之前census所用网络的一样，“yes”编码(网络的输出)为(1,0), “no”编码为(0,1)
2.该数据集的受保护特性为年龄age，将其分为了四个年龄段18-45，46-60，61-80，81-95.分别对应a1,a2,a3,a4类别。a1_feature.txt里面为第一个年龄段的采样数据，16个特性，可用于输入到bank.pt计算对应的输出结果。
3.data_feature里面为原数据集处理得到的数字型输入，包含测试集和训练集的输入，data_label为训练集和测试集的标签数据。
